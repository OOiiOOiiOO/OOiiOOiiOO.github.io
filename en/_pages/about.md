Dear students, ðŸŒ±  

This website has been created to support your learning journey and to serve as a reliable source of academic resources. Here you will find lecture notes, references, study roadmaps, and course-related materials for the classes you take with me.  

But this platform is not just about providing materials. I strongly believe that true learning happens through collaboration, research, and active participation. By contributing to knowledge sharing, engaging in research projects, and co-authoring papers, you can not only achieve **better results in your courses**, but also **build a strong academic and professional rÃ©sumÃ©**.

### Academic Vision
Within the Computer Engineering Department at Marlik University, my vision is to create a dynamic and inspiring environment where:  
- students move beyond textbooks,  
- research projects become real opportunities,  
- and academic growth is achieved through teamwork and collaboration.

### An Invitation
I warmly invite you to bring your ideas, projects, and energy to this shared academic journey. Our goal is not only to pass courses, but to shape a future where **your scientific knowledge and research skills become lasting assets**.

### Closing
Thank you for being part of this path. I hope this website will serve as both an informative resource and a source of motivation for you.  

With best regards,  

**Mohammad Mahdi Khorsand Aalam**  

Lecturer of Computer Engineering  
Marlik University of Nowshahr
