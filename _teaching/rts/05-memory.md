# Memory Management in Real-Time Operating Systems

Memory management is a crucial part of Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS).  
Since RTOS must provide **predictable timing** and **efficient resource usage**, the way memory is allocated, swapped, or shared among processes directly affects system performance.

## Swapping

- **Swapping** is a simple method where the operating system moves processes in and out of main memory to allow multiple processes to execute.  
- Some programs remain **memory resident** (always in memory), while others are swapped in and out as needed.  
- When a process is swapped out, it is marked as **suspended**, and its **context** (state) is saved.  
- Later, the dispatcher reloads the context into memory and resumes execution.

## Overlay

- **Overlay** is a technique that allows execution of a program **larger than the available physical memory**.  
- A fixed part of the program remains in memory, while other parts (data/code segments) are loaded on demand.  
- Overlays expand the effective address space but introduce **overhead** since new sections must be fetched from disk.  
- In **real-time systems**, overlays may negatively impact performance due to unpredictable access times.

## Page/Block Management

- In this method, user memory space is divided into **fixed-size partitions** (pages or blocks).  
- This allows more than one process to stay in memory simultaneously.  
- It is one of the most common approaches to improve memory utilization.

## Fragmentation Problem

- **Memory fragmentation** occurs when memory becomes divided into many small, unusable sections.  
- This is especially problematic in RTOS, since **predictable timing** is required.  
- A common solution is **memory compaction**, which reorganizes memory to combine free blocks.  
- However, compaction is costly and cannot always move certain unmovable blocks (e.g., the OS kernel).

## Key Takeaways

- **Swapping** enables multitasking but requires careful handling of process suspension and context switching.  
- **Overlay** supports execution of large programs but may harm real-time performance due to disk access.  
- **Page/Block Management** improves simultaneous memory usage through partitioning.  
- **Fragmentation** is a major challenge in RTOS, and while compaction helps, it introduces overhead.
