# Task and Memory Management in Real-Time Operating Systems

In Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS), a **task** is a set of instructions that can be executed on a processor.  
Each task competes with other tasks for execution, and the RTOS is responsible for **scheduling, prioritization, and resource management**.  

---

## Task in RTOS

- A task is **schedulable**.  
- Each task has a **specific priority**.  
- For every task, a **stack space** and a set of **CPU registers** are assigned.

## Task Control Block (TCB)

One of the most well-known approaches for task management in RTOS is the **Task Control Block (TCB)** model.  

- TCB is a **private data structure** for each task.  
- The OS maintains a list of TCBs (usually in a linked-list form).  
- Information such as task state, stack pointer, registers, and priority is stored in the TCB.

## Inter-task Communication and Synchronization

RTOS provides several mechanisms for **communication** and **synchronization** between tasks to ensure correct and orderly execution.  

### 1. Buffers

- **Double Buffers:**  
  Two separate buffers are used; one is being filled while the other is emptied. Switching can be handled either by hardware or software.  

- **Shared Linear Buffer:**  
  Involves the classic **Readers–Writers Problem**, where multiple writers and readers access a limited shared buffer.  

- **Circular Buffer:**  
  Tasks write data at the end of the buffer and read from the beginning.  
  As long as the head and tail indices are not equal, reading and writing can happen simultaneously.

### 2. Mailbox

- A Mailbox is a **specific memory space** that one or more tasks can use for **data transfer and synchronization**.  
- Access must be **mutually exclusive (Mutual Exclusion)**.  
- Tasks may need to **wait** if the mailbox is busy.  
- Two main operations:  
  - `pend(data, &s)` → receive data and lock  
  - `post(data, &s)` → send data and release

### 3. Semaphore

- One of the most commonly used mechanisms for protecting **critical sections** and shared resources.  
- A **binary semaphore** works like a lock/unlock mechanism.  
- Two primary operations:  
  - `wait` → request access and lock  
  - `signal` → release the resource

## Memory Management in RTOS

### 1. Context Switching  

In multitasking systems, the RTOS must perform **Context Switching** between tasks.  

- A task’s context includes its registers, stack, and execution state.  
- During a switch, the current task’s information is saved, and the next task’s context is restored.  

### 2. Role of TCB in Memory Management  

- In the TCB model, a list of **TCBs** is maintained (either static or dynamic).  
- Each TCB contains a pointer to its task’s stack.  
- Stacks should be **carefully allocated** based on task priority and system requirements.

## Key Takeaways

- Each task is an **independent schedulable unit**.  
- **TCB** is the core structure for task management in RTOS.  
- Inter-task communication can be achieved through **Buffers, Mailboxes, and Semaphores**.  
- Memory management and **Context Switching** play a crucial role in RTOS performance.
