# Practical Projects in Real-Time Operating Systems

To better understand the concepts of Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS), several light but practical projects are proposed.  
These projects help students not only learn theoretical aspects but also gain hands-on experience.

## 1. Task Scheduling Simulation

**Description:**  
In this project, students implement and compare different task scheduling algorithms, including:  

- **FCFS (First Come First Serve)**  
- **Round Robin**  
- **Priority Scheduling**  

**Implementation Guide:**  
- Input: A list of tasks with arrival time and burst time.  
- Output: Generate a **Gantt Chart** showing how tasks are scheduled.  
- Suggested Tools: Python (with matplotlib for visualization).  

**Learning Outcome:**  
Students will understand how scheduling algorithms affect **response time and task execution** in RTOS.

## 2. Semaphore Simulation for Critical Section

**Description:**  
This project focuses on the concept of **Critical Sections** and using **Semaphore/Mutex** to manage access to shared resources.  

**Implementation Guide:**  
- Define two or more tasks trying to access a shared variable.  
- Use Semaphore to prevent simultaneous access.  
- Show the difference in execution before and after Semaphore usage.  

**Learning Outcome:**  
Students will practically understand **Synchronization** and how it prevents **Race Conditions**.

## 3. Mailbox / Buffer Simulation (Producer–Consumer Problem)

**Description:**  
This project is designed to teach **Inter-task Communication**.  

**Implementation Guide:**  
- Implement the **Producer-Consumer Model** using:  
  - Double Buffer  
  - or Circular Buffer  
- The producer generates data and places it in the buffer.  
- The consumer reads data from the buffer.  
- Display the buffer’s status at each moment.  

**Learning Outcome:**  
Students will learn how tasks communicate and exchange data using **Buffers and Mailboxes**.

## 4. Memory Management Simulation (Paging & Fragmentation)

**Description:**  
This project highlights the problem of **Memory Management**.  

**Implementation Guide:**  
- Simulate memory as an array with fixed size.  
- Add processes with varying sizes to memory.  
- Show **Fragmentation** in memory.  
- Implement **Compaction** to reorganize memory and display the result.  

**Learning Outcome:**  
Students will clearly see the issue of **Fragmentation** and understand why memory management is critical in RTOS.

## 5. Simple RTOS Execution on Lightweight Hardware (Arduino / ESP32)

**Description:**  
This optional project is designed for students who are interested in hardware.  

**Implementation Guide:**  
- Use **Arduino Uno** or **ESP32** (affordable and accessible boards).  
- Install **FreeRTOS** (available as a library for these boards).  
- Define simple tasks such as:  
  - Blinking an LED at different intervals.  
  - Reading data from a simple sensor.  
- Observe how the RTOS manages multiple tasks.  

**Learning Outcome:**  
Students will experience working with a **real RTOS** and see how tasks are scheduled and executed on actual hardware.

## Summary

- These projects are designed to be simple so that students can focus on learning RTOS concepts without heavy complexity.  
- Each project focuses on a key RTOS concept: **Scheduling, Synchronization, Inter-task Communication, Memory Management, and Hands-on RTOS Practice**.  
- The ultimate goal is for students to understand RTOS concepts **not only in theory but also in practice**.
