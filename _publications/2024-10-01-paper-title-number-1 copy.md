we introduce three novel corner detection algorithms that leverage the concept of gradient
isotropy within the framework of the structure tensor matrix to enhance detection accuracy and
robustness. By analyzing the eigenvalues of the structure tensor, we assess the isotropy of im-
age gradients, distinguishing corners from edges and flat regions. The proposed corner response
functions—QEG, Qs, and QH —utilize different mathematical formulations to measure gradient
isotropy. The QEG method computes the ratio of the determinant to the trace of the structure
tensor, emphasizing regions with high gradient isotropy. The Qs method analyzes the squared
structure tensor matrix to capture higher-order gradient interactions, enhancing sensitivity to
subtle isotropic variations. The QH method incorporates the Heinz mean with a tunable parame-
ter, providing flexibility in measuring gradient isotropy to balance sensitivity and robustness. We
evaluate the performance of our algorithms through extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real-world images, including challenging conditions with noise and geometric transformations. The

corners even in complex textured images. Specifically, QH with geometric mean algorithm shows
remarkable resilience in noisy environments. By integrating gradient isotropy analysis within the
structure tensor framework, our methods provide reliable and adaptable tools for accurately identi-
fying corners.
